# Spark-Popular-User-Detection

This project identifies the most “popular” users on the Twitter network, measured by the number of their followers.

Parse the twitter.edges to obtain the Twitter follower-following graph, perform necessary computation, and return the list of all (userid, follower_count) pairs for the users with more than 1000 followers.
